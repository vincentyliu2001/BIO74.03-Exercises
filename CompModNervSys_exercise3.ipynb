In this case, we're modeling the membrane conductance as *passive*, i.e., ignoring the presence of nonlinear voltage gated ion channels. This turns out to be a decent model of neuronal membranes at voltages near equilibrium, since the nonlinear currents are still small. The circuit is composed of the membrane capacitance $C_{m}$ in parallel with a resistor $R$ representing an ionic conductance ($g=1/R$) with a reversal potential $E_{rev}$. This is sometimes referred to as the *leak* conductance and is simply the total conductance of the membrane's ion channels at rest lumped together and treated as passive (non-voltage dependent).

        "As you may know from a differential equations course, the product $RC$ in this equation is also known as the time constant $\\tau$. In our case, this is known as the *membrane time constant* and is given the special symbol $\\tau_{m}$. It has units of time ($\\Omega \\cdot F = sec$, or $k\\Omega \\cdot \\mu F = ms$). From inspecting the equation or your plot, you can see it's the time at which the voltage reaches 63.2% ($1-1/e$) of it's steady state value (or increases by 36.8%). In general, the time constant is a measure of how fast the membrane voltage can change in response to a stimulus (shorter times being faster). In our artificial situation, this was an instant change in bath concentrations, but later, this will be currents generated by synaptic inputs or electrical stimulation we apply. \n",

        "Below, try overlaying plots of the same manipulation if the time constant was doubled or halved. "
