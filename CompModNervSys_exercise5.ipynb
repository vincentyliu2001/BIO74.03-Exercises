        "So far, we've simulated the *passive* properties of neurons. But as we know, as soon as the membrane potential reaches a critical value, known as the *threshold*, neurons fire action potentials (or \"spikes\"). Next class, we'll start introducing the detailed model of the squid axon developed by Alan Hodgkin and Alduous Huxley in 1952, which has mostly held up for over 70 years. In the most basic terms, action potentials consist of a neuron's membrane voltage increasing due to inputs (whether from current injection or synapses), reaching a threshold, rapidly going to a high depolarized value, then returning back to the rest potential and being unable to fire for some period of time, termed the refractory period. \n",
        "\n",
        "People have modeled this \"phenomenologically\" for decades using the leaky integrate and fire neuron model, which simply adds a nonlinearity to this otherwise linear model. Whenever the votlage reaches a threshold (we define), we basically say the cell \"fired\", reset its potential to rest, and hold it there until the refractory period is over. Spikes are treated as an instantaneous event that's not actually captured by the voltage dynamics of the model. We could artificially force the voltage to a value of our choosing (say +40 mV), but typically people are more interested in the spike *timing* when using these models. \n",
